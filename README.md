# The Fair Food Framework
Proof of concept for a Design Engineering Futures project using DLT, facilitating food security through food waste reduction by systemising the way surplus food is redistributed to emergency food aid charities and food banks.

We created a proof of concept for a retail-facing API for our system. A QR code represents a food item such as an apple. Scanning it automatically adds the item to a distributed ledger.
