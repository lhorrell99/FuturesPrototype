# FuturesPrototype
Proof of concept for DE3 Futures 2021 DLT project.
Watch our 2-minute explanation of the project : https://youtu.be/tBxpfw7ndc4

We created a proof of concept for a retail-facing API for our system. A QR code represents a food item such as an apple. Scanning it automatically adds the item to a distributed ledger.
